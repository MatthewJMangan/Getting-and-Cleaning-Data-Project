## General Description
This is a desription of the data output generated by script run_analysis.R.

## Data Collection
Data came from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, which
can be found at this link:  

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

That link details this description: "The experiments have been carried out with 
a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person 
performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 
SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the 
waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear 
acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The 
experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained 
dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers 
was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying 
noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 
50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has 
gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth 
low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force 
is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz 
cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained 
by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain."

## Transformations to Raw Data
Raw data sets were loaded into tables in R before undergoing the following 
transformations.

1 - Data Training (X_train) and test (X_test) data sets were bound into a single
table "x" using the rbind() function

2 - Reference tables for the training (y_train) and test (y_test) data sets were 
bound into a single table "y" using the rbind() function  

3 - Subject reference tables for the training (subject_train) and test 
(subject_test) data sets were bound into a single table "subject" using the
rbind() function

4 - All data "x", "y", and "subject" was bound into a single data frame "DF" 
using the cbind() function

5 - Only columns "subject", "code" and mean and standard deviation measurements 
were subsetted from the data set using the function select()

6 - "Activity" names was added as a column into the table DF using merge(), using
column "code" as the index variables

7 - Variable names in DF were adjusted for readability and clarity as follows:  
- Acc was replaced with Accelerometer  
- Gyro was replaced with Gyroscope  
- Mag was replaced with Magnitude  
- Freq was replaced with Frequency  
- "t" prefix was replaced with time  
- "f" prefix was replaced with freqency  
- A _ spacing was added in between words of variable names  

8 - The resulting data set from step 7 was summarized as the average of each 
variable to create a new data set DF5. This data is output into Final_Data.txt

## Variable Names

Variable names in the output data set Final_Data.txt are as follows:

[1] "subject" - contains ID of subject undergoing activity rainging from 1-30  
[2] "activity" - contains six possible activity values: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING  
[3] "code" - contains number coded values associated with "activity" variable
